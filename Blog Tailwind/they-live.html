                    <p>A lone drifter stumbles upon a harrowing discovery â€“ a unique
                        pair of sunglasses that reveals that aliens are systematically
                        gaining control of the Earth by masquerading as humans and
                        lulling the public into submission.</p>

            <p>Keith David is one of those guys where it's like, he should have
                gotten 45 extra opportunities in the 80s but just didn't. His
                first big break is The Thing and then it's a full four years
                before he even appears in another film. I look at him in The
                Thing and it's like Ripley in Alien; the unknown but compelling
                newcomer that outlives the bloodshed to the end credits. In a
                sane world that role catapults him to Sigourney-level stardom.
                But it didn't happen. And I think he is perfect in They Live
                playing off Roddy. They are a dynamic duo that leave you craving
                more camaraderie than there already is. </p>

            <p>The way Carpenter moves his camera. There isn't a speck of urgency
                to it. He really is the Howard Hawks of Horror. He will just shoot
                it plain and simple, and in that is a kind of caution, or
                reassurance, that is sober and calming. I'm always drawn to the
                steady hand and J.C. doesn't flinch.</p>
