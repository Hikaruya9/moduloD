                <p class="synopsis">A wealthy New York investment banking executive hides his alternate psychopathic
                    ego from his co-workers and friends as he escalates deeper into his illogical,
                    gratuitous fantasies.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Review:</h2>
            <p>A social satire on the materialistic, self-obsessed & money-driven yuppie generation of 1980s America
                that also mocks male narcissism in the process, American Psycho presents a community made up of people
                who have all the luxury that money can buy yet no individuality of their own, a world where everyone
                looks, dresses & acts exactly the same, and measure themselves only by their external appearances &
                material possessions.
                <br><br>
                Based on the novel of the same name, the story follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy, narcissistic &
                material-obsessed investment banker living in New York during the late 1980s who's a stereotype of the
                yuppie generation and leads a secret life as a serial killer. But the mask of outer perfection he's put
                up so well to hide his psychopathic persona from his co-workers & friends begins to slip when he delves
                deeper into his darker fantasies.
                <br><br>
                Co-written & directed by Mary Harron, American Psycho is a captivating study of a madman who
                simultaneously obsesses & criticises the shallow culture he is a part of and attempts to hide his
                chaotic personal life through excessive vanity & beautification. Harron's direction is impressive, for
                she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction & reality and
                although the ambiguity is maintained for the most part, it inadvertently falls apart in the last scene.
                <br><br>
                The screenplay is no slouch, for the story maintains its stringent focus on its lead character who is
                present in almost every single scene. Everything is told from Bateman's perspective and it is through
                his decadent lifestyle that the writers are critiquing the hedonistic society he simply happens to be a
                byproduct of. The script also showcases a fine balance between the elements of comedy & horror and there
                are moments which will be disturbing to some but hilarious to others for the exact same reason.
