                    must leave his home in order to keep it from falling into the hands of its evil creator.
                    Along the way, a fellowship is formed to protect the ringbearer and make sure that the ring
                    arrives at its final destination: Mt. Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed.</p>

                Whenever an acclaimed novel is chosen for a film adaptation, the biggest concern its fans generally have
                is whether or not the film will capture the essence of the story in the same manner as the author did.
                And so when it was decided to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings on the big screen, the
                expectation was so monumental that the trilogy was almost doomed to fail, for this legendary
                Middle-Earth saga was no mere literary work but over years had garnered such an unprecedented reputation
                that it was deemed unfilmable by many, including Tolkien himself.
                <br><br>
                Nevertheless, the first trailers were enthusiastically received and anticipation kept building until in
                December 2001, everyone from Tolkien fans to critics & filmgoers lined up just to see if the first
                chapter of the most ambitious project ever undertaken in cinema history lives up to its surmounting hype
                or not. And not only did The Fellowship of the Ring succeed in surpassing all the sky-high expectations
                with effortless ease but brought alive Middle-Earth in such breathtaking detail that it set a whole new
                standard for epic filmmaking, which remains unsurpassed as of today.
                <br><br>
                Tolkien's Lord of the Rings was meant to be seen as a single work divided into three volumes and such is
                the case with its film adaptation too. Opening with a perfectly narrated prologue that welcomes even the
                newcomers into its world with smooth comfort while setting the tone for the events ahead, The Fellowship
                of the Ring tells the story of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who inadvertently possesses the One Ring
                that once belonged to the Dark Lord Sauron, and is ultimately tasked with the mission to destroy it
                before it falls into the hands of the evil. The subtitle refers to the fellowship of companions who join
                Frodo in the quest.
                <br><br>
                Director Peter Jackson was a relatively unknown filmmaker till he helmed this project and what really
                helped the cause is his proper understanding of Tolkien world and what works on film & what does not.
                The script he wrote with Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens is structured to have a universal appeal so it
                could please both fans of the novel as well as first-time viewers. Jackson's direction is even more
                impressive as each & every aspect achieves perfection under his distinct cinematic vision and the
                emphasis given to smallest of details is downright admirable as well.
