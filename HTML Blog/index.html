            <h2 class="subtitle">Synopsis:</h2>
            <p>In the smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles of 2019, blade runner Rick Deckard 
                is called out of retirement to terminate a quartet of replicants who have escaped 
                to Earth seeking their creator for a way to extend their short life spans.</p>

            <p>
                Blade Dunner is a sci-fi noir thriller where Harrison Ford must seek out and destroy all the 
                “Replicants” or robots designed to look and act just like humans, except emotionally. This futuristic 
                tale is well ahead of its times both thematically and in its VFX execution.
                <br> <br>
                Instead of the original, I watched what was called “The Final Cut.” This director’s cut of the film 
                removes the tired Harrison Ford voiceovers and just has silence or music in its place. I really 
                preferred this version over the original as I felt this was given more of a noir, atmospheric vibe and 
                the voiceovers were largely unnecessary or insulted the viewers intelligence. 
                <br> <br>
                The film has a very basic plot and doesn’t deviate much from Decker’s chase to catch every Replicant. 
                The Rachael story touches on what it would happen if Replicants with emotions and unaware that they were 
                a robot. While interesting, it kind of detracts from the overall story and doesn’t lead to much. 
                <br> <br>
                Overall I respect this film immensely for what it is able to accomplish for its time and the inspiration 
                it has given to sci-fi since then. I would highly recommend everyone check out Blade Runner: The Final 
                Cut if they’ve only seen the theatrical release.

            <p>Young hobbit Frodo Baggins, after inheriting a mysterious ring from his uncle Bilbo,

                Magical, astounding filmmaking. This could've turned out terribly, oh so terribly, but it didn't. 
                It sure didn't. It's a near-perfect cinematic experience and adaptation, delicately told right from 
                the opening exposition dump that haunts the very marrow of my bones. A world with so much beauty soon 
                becomes tarnished by darkness. It only becomes clear around the 45 minute mark why Jackson was chosen 
                for the project; his craft is sweeping and relentlessly classical. Only a splatter and adventure geek 
                could evoke such crumbling destruction and still sell every mythical, at times overwrought, line of 
                dialogue; he believes in it. The world was real to Tolkien, it was real to Jackson, and it's real to 
                the audience.

            <h2 class="subtitle">Synopsis:</h2>
            <p>A wealthy New York investment banking executive hides his alternate psychopathic 
                ego from his co-workers and friends as he escalates deeper into his illogical, 
                gratuitous fantasies.</p>

            <p>Displays surreal tendencies while deconstructing materialism, hyper-masculinity, 
                and the superficial facade of a man consumed by greed and appearances. it’s so 
                much fun watching this psychological satire unfold as it’s critique on capitalism 
                and the violence of the corporate elite thickens. you can’t help but laugh your 
                way through this film, simultaneously fascinated by its commentary and ambiguity.
