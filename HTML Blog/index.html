                Blade Dunner is a sci-fi noir thriller where Harrison Ford must seek out and destroy all the
                “Replicants” or robots designed to look and act just like humans, except emotionally. This futuristic
                tale is well ahead of its times both thematically and in its VFX execution...

                Whenever an acclaimed novel is chosen for a film adaptation, the biggest concern its fans generally have
                is whether or not the film will capture the essence of the story in the same manner as the author did.
                And so when it was decided to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings on the big screen, the
                expectation was so monumental that the trilogy was almost doomed to fail, for this legendary
                Middle-Earth saga was no mere literary work but over years had garnered such an unprecedented reputation

            <p>A social satire on the materialistic, self-obsessed & money-driven yuppie generation of 1980s America
                that also mocks male narcissism in the process, American Psycho presents a community made up of people
                who have all the luxury that money can buy yet no individuality of their own, a world where everyone
                looks, dresses & acts exactly the same, and measure themselves only by their external appearances &
                material possessions...
