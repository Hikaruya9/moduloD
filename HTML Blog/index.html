            <p>In the smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles of 2019, blade runner Rick Deckard <br>
                is called out of retirement to terminate a quartet of replicants who have escaped <br>
                to Earth seeking their creator for a way to extend their short life spans.</p>

            <h2>Review:</h2>
            <p>
                Blade Dunner is a sci-fi noir thriller where Harrison Ford must seek out and destroy all the <br>
                “Replicants” or robots designed to look and act just like humans, except emotionally. This futuristic
                <br>
                tale is well ahead of its times both thematically and in its VFX execution. <br>
                <br>
                Instead of the original, I watched what was called “The Final Cut.” This director’s cut of the film <br>
                removes the tired Harrison Ford voiceovers and just has silence or music in its place. I really <br>
                preferred this version over the original as I felt this was given more of a noir, atmospheric vibe and
                <br>
                the voiceovers were largely unnecessary or insulted the viewers intelligence. <br>
                <br>
                The film has a very basic plot and doesn’t deviate much from Decker’s chase to catch every Replicant.
                <br>
                The Rachael story touches on what it would happen if Replicants with emotions and unaware that they were
                <br>
                a robot. While interesting, it kind of detracts from the overall story and doesn’t lead to much. <br>
                <br>
                Overall I respect this film immensely for what it is able to accomplish for its time and the inspiration
                <br>
                it has given to sci-fi since then. I would highly recommend everyone check out Blade Runner: The Final
                <br>
                Cut if they’ve only seen the theatrical release. <br>
