                    is called out of retirement to terminate a quartet of replicants who have escaped
                    to Earth seeking their creator for a way to extend their short life spans.</p>

            <p>
                Blade Dunner is a sci-fi noir thriller where Harrison Ford must seek out and destroy all the
                “Replicants” or robots designed to look and act just like humans, except emotionally. This futuristic
                tale is well ahead of its times both thematically and in its VFX execution.
                <br> <br>
                Instead of the original, I watched what was called “The Final Cut.” This director’s cut of the film
                removes the tired Harrison Ford voiceovers and just has silence or music in its place. I really
                preferred this version over the original as I felt this was given more of a noir, atmospheric vibe and
                the voiceovers were largely unnecessary or insulted the viewers intelligence.
                <br> <br>
                The film has a very basic plot and doesn’t deviate much from Decker’s chase to catch every Replicant.
                The Rachael story touches on what it would happen if Replicants with emotions and unaware that they were
                a robot. While interesting, it kind of detracts from the overall story and doesn’t lead to much.
                <br> <br>
                Overall I respect this film immensely for what it is able to accomplish for its time and the inspiration
                it has given to sci-fi since then. I would highly recommend everyone check out Blade Runner: The Final
                Cut if they’ve only seen the theatrical release.
